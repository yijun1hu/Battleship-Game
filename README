RULES
---------------
You have a board of 7Ã—7.
BOARD:
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7
a - - - - - - -
b - - - - - - -
c - - - - - - -
d - - - - - - -
e - - - - - - -
f - - - - - - -
g - - - - - - -

You will have 5 ships in total:
	 - 2 boats of size 2
	 - 2 boats of size 3
	 - 1 boat of size 5

KEY: 
' ' = nothing there
'b' = boat
'm' = missed
'h' = hit
 
 The first thing you should do is to place the boats in the game board.
 Please Note: Boats can only go vertically or horizontally a letter means row 
 and a number means column!
	Ex. to input a boat of size 3 in a vertical row, input 1 a b c
		or to input a boat of size 2 in a horizontal row input a 1 2
	Note: Make sure there are spaces between the input and the outputs.
 
 The goal of the game is to sink all of your opponents ships before they
 sink all of your ships. A player has 2 different boards, 'my board' has where
 your ships are located and 'playing board' keeps track of all of 
 your opponent's ships that you have hit or missed.
 
 To fire, first give the row and then the number.
 	Ex. to fire at position a 1, simply input in 'a 1'.
 		to fire at position 7 d, simplying input in 'd 7'.
 	
 	Note: Make sure there are spaces between the input and the outputs.
 	Note: Make sure that it follows the format "row col" or "letter number"
 			or else it will be considered invalid.
